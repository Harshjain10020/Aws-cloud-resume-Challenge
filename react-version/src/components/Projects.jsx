          <strong>Description:</strong> As a Top 8 Finalist out of 400+ teams at
          the PEARS Global Hackathon 2025 , I co-developed a secure peer-to-peer
          investigation platform. I delivered a fault-tolerant, distributed P2P
          communication system enabling low-latency chat, room creation, and
          file sharing. I also implemented a community moderation system that
          improved platform trust by reducing unverified content.
